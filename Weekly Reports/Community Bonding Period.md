## Community Bonding Period 

I was genuinely excited when I came across the project “Improvements in User Response (Loading and Saving Files)”. I love working on features that make the app feel responsive and alive. I still feel really lucky this project got selected by Google — working on something you enjoy doesn’t feel like a task. You get into it, and time just flies.

In community Bonding period, I focused on understanding the codebase and how the 3D surface export process is structured. Instead of just browsing through files, I took time to trace the logic step-by-step. While some parts were initially complex, things gradually started making sense with continued exploration.

After a discussion with my mentor, we decided to shift the project scope to focus on exporting 3D surfaces, as that’s where feedback is currently missing and most impactful. This helped bring more clarity to the direction of the project.

I also started learning wxPython, which was new to me. I explored how dialogs work and how they could be integrated into the UI to give users better visual feedback during exports.

### What I Learned
- Large codebases can feel overwhelming at first, but breaking them down step-by-step makes them easier to navigate.
- Early discussions with mentors can really help clarify priorities and shape the project direction.
- It’s okay to not know a tool (like wxPython) from day one — exploring it through small experiments helped me understand it better.
- When you're working on something you're genuinely interested in, it doesn’t feel like work — you naturally stay focused and curious.
