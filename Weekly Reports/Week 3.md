## Week 3
After optimizing the progress bar speed in Week 2, I focused on refining the user experience for surface exports. The key improvement this week was ensuring that the progress dialog closes automatically after the export finishes, instead of requiring manual dismissal.
This feature was not straightforward because:
- VTK writers do not provide real-time progress updates, so I implemented simulated progress logic that runs before and after the actual writer.Write() call.

I controlled the progress updates using a loop, incrementing the percentage in steps (e.g., 10%, 20%, ... up to 90%), and then set it to 100% after the file was successfully written.
Once the export reached 100%, the dialog was closed programmatically using progress.Destroy(), ensuring no dangling UI elements.

I also handled edge cases:
- If the user cancels during the process, the dialog closes immediately, and partial files are cleaned up.
- Verified that the auto-close did not break cancel functionality or cause UI freezes by using wx.Yield() for responsiveness.
- This improvement significantly enhanced the overall user experience, making the export workflow smoother and more intuitive.
