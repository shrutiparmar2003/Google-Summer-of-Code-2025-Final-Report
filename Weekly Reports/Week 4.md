## Week 4: Adding Progress Bars for Full 3D Scene Exports
After stabilizing the progress dialog logic for surface exports, I moved on to full 3D scene exports, which are handled in viewer_volume.py. These include formats such as OBJ, X3D, VRML, RIB, and IV.

Key tasks in this week:
- Implemented a simulated progress mechanism for these exporters, similar to what was done in surface.py, because VTK exporters for these formats also do not provide real-time progress callbacks.
- Designed the dialog to:
   
   - Show status messages like “Preparing export…”, “Exporting file: XX%”, and “Finalizing export…”.
   - Include a Cancel button to stop the export gracefully if needed.
   - Automatically close when export completes, ensuring consistency with surface exports.

- Carefully integrated this logic without breaking the existing rendering flow:
   - Used wx.Yield() during updates to keep the UI responsive.
   - Verified that cancellation stops the export and prevents partially written files.

- Maintained full support for all these scene-based formats by linking the progress updates to their respective VTK exporters (vtkOBJExporter, vtkVRMLExporter, vtkRIBExporter, vtkX3DExporter, vtkIVExporter).

This update ensured a unified user experience across both surface and scene exports, making the process more transparent and user-friendly, even for large datasets.
