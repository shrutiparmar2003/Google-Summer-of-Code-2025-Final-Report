After completing the core implementation in the first four weeks, I focused on polishing the codebase, improving documentation, and testing across a wide range of 3D export formats (.stl, .ply, .obj, .iv, .rib, etc.). I also cleaned up internal logic, added docstrings, and ensured consistency in naming and structure.

During this time, I finalized and submitted the pull request, ensuring that all deliverables matched the original project proposal.
