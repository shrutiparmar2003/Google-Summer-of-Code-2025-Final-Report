After completing the core implementation in the first four weeks, I focused on polishing the codebase, improving documentation, and testing across a wide range of 3D export formats (.stl, .ply, .obj, .iv, .rib, etc.). I also cleaned up internal logic, added docstrings, and ensured consistency in naming and structure.

During this time, I finalized and submitted the pull request, ensuring that all deliverables matched the original project proposal. I prepared a comprehensive draft of the GSoC final report, linking all relevant resources to make the work easy to review and extend.

The code is functionally complete, tested, and ready to be merged. I remain available to incorporate any final suggestions.
