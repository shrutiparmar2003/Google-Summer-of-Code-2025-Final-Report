### Week 6 to Week 8

During these final weeks, I focused on wrapping up all deliverables and preparing the submission package for GSoC. This included:

- Finalizing and proofreading the code to ensure clarity, readability, and maintainability  
- Conducting additional tests across various 3D surface export formats to verify progress tracking, cancellation behavior, and error handling  
- Cleaning up the project branch and ensuring all commits were properly pushed  
- Preparing a comprehensive **Google Summer of Code final report**, which documents all work completed, links to the pull request and related issue, and outlines the current project status  

The project is complete and ready to be merged. I remain available to implement any further suggestions post-submission if required.
