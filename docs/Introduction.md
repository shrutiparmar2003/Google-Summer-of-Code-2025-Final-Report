## 1. Introduction

This project, part of **Google Summer of Code 2025**, aims to enhance the 3D surface export process in **InVesalius**, a widely used open-source medical imaging platform.

Previously, users had no visibility or control during exportsâ€”especially challenging for large or complex surfaces. This contribution introduces a **cancellable progress dialog** that provides real-time feedback and allows users to interrupt the process if needed.

It also adds support for two additional export formats (`.iv`, `.rib`) and ensures robust error handling and cleanup, resulting in a more reliable and user-friendly export experience.
