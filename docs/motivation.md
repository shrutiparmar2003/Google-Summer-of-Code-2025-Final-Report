## 2. Motivation

- **Lack of Feedback**: Users had no indication of export progress, leaving them uncertain about the operation’s status.
- **No Cancel Option**: Once an export started, it could not be interrupted—even if it was taking too long.
- **User Frustration**: This was especially frustrating with large or complex 3D surfaces that took significant time to export.
- **Perceived Freezing**: Without progress feedback, long exports appeared unresponsive.
- **Improved UX Needed**: There was a clear need to improve transparency, responsiveness, and control in the export process.
